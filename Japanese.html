   <h3> <p>
    There are plenty of reasons why people learn Japanese; studying for the JLPT, preparing to go to Japan for vacation, or just enjoying Japanese culture.

    Among the many options to study Japanese, language apps are some of the most popular types of resources. Not only are they affordable, and sometimes free, but they also allow for a lot of flexibility when learning. However, they may not always make the most comprehensive solutions and are usually best used as supplementary resources or in conjunction with other resources.

    We’ll be taking a look at some of our favorite Japanese language apps, organized by category. This list is nowhere near comprehensive, but it’s a good portion of the many apps we’ve tested as well as some popular alternatives to help you learn Japanese. </h3>
