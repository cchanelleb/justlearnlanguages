  <h3> <br>1) Learn Korean with an immersion based course <br> </h3>
 
 <br> The best way to learn Korean is through immersion. Immersion is a language learning technique that uses as little of your native language as possible to teach you your target language. <br>

 <br>Why immersion is the best way to learn Korean
 With language immersion you start using Korean even before you fully understand vocabulary and grammar. You start to learn about grammar and exact word definitions only after you’ve interacted with the language by listening, reading, or speaking. <br>

 <br> Learning Korean this way helps train your brain to think in Korean. At first you don’t know the exact grammar rules or translation behind the phrases you’re using and as a result you can’t translate anything in your head from English to Korean or vice versa. <br>

 

 <br>But being surrounded by a foreign language doesn’t necessarily mean you’re learning anything. If you want to learn Korean it’s important to immerse yourself in the language at an appropriate level so that you don’t get lost or feel intimidated. <br>

 <br>This is where language courses come in. The right Korean language course will expose you to just enough Korean to push your skills and get you thinking in the language. With an immersion based method you will learn Korean words in the context of full dialogues or conversations. <br>


<h3> <br> 2) Listen to Korean podcasts <br> </h3>
 Podcasts are a great way to improve your listening comprehension skills and learn Korean vocabulary. When you start learning Korean it’s best to listen to podcasts specifically designed for language learning. These podcasts typically include short audio lessons that use a mix of Korean and English. As your proficiency in Korean increases you can make the jump to podcasts that are 100% in Korean. These can either be advanced language learning podcasts or podcasts that native speakers listen to. <br>

 <br>One of best Korean podcasts for beginners is ChoiSusu. Each Episode on is about 8 mins long. Each podcast is about a specific topic in korean. There are hundreds of other options like Didi's hangul podcast and Talk to me in Korean. <br>


 <h3> <br>3) Download a korean language app <br> </h3>
 Another great way to learn Korean is with language learning apps. There are more apps for learning Korean than ever before, so no matter what your learning style or level is you’re bound to find one that’s right for you. <br>

 <br>One of our favorite apps for learning Korean is Pimsleur. Pimsleur Korean is a great app if you want to learn to speak Korean. It teaches you conversational phrases and helps you practice them by prompting you to answer and ask questions in Korean. <br>

 <br>What I love about Pimsleur is that you learn how to say phrases syllable by syllable as you repeat after a native speaker. This helps with pronunciation and with your listening skills. It also makes Korean phrases easier to remember in a way that’s just not possible with other language apps. <br>

 <br>As you work through the Korean lessons on Pimsleur, the course will take phrases you have used in different forms. Sometimes you’ll address one person, sometimes two. Sometimes you’ll ask a question to a woman and other times to a man. The phrases will change based on who you’re talking to. In doing this Pimsleur is actually teaching you Korean grammar, without explicitly explaining any rules. This is a great immersion technique that you just don’t find in other Korean apps! <br>


 <h3> <br>4) Watch Korean movies and TV <br> </h3>
  Watching Korean media is an effective way to learn Korean while at the same time exposing yourself to Korean culture. Korean dramas and films are more popular than ever. If you have access to the internet you will have no shortage of movies and tv shows to choose from. <br>


 <h3> <br> 5) Learn Hangul <br> </h3>
 <br>The Korean writing system might look intimidating, but there’s good news. The Korean alphabet (called Hangul) was specifically designed to make it easy to read Korean! In Hangul there are 14 basic consonants and 10 basic vowel letters. These basic letter symbols can be combined to form another 27 complex letters, which are read as combinations of the basic letters.

 Another interesting feature of hangul is that it’s written in syllable groups. If you want to read hangul you’ll be happy to know that the writing system is completely phonetic, meaning that Korean is also written as it sounds. <br>

  <h3> <br> 6) Listen to Korean Music <br> </h3>
 If you haven’t already noticed, K pop (Korean pop music) is taking over the world. Artists like Black Pink and BTS are selling out stadiums worldwide, not just in South Korea. Fortunately as a Korean learner you can take all of this awesome music and make it part of your language learning routine. <br>

 
 <h3> <br> 7) Practice speaking Korean with native speakers <br> </h3>
 Speaking Korean with real people is absolutely necessary if you want to reach fluency. For a new language learner talking to someone in a second language be intimidating. Because of this a lot of beginners opt out of speaking and instead concentrate on reading and writing in Korean. <br>
